# Playground

The Portals playground is a JavaScript-based sandbox capable of running Portals applications that hosts a code editor for writing programs and an output log. It comes with a JavaScript API, and the runtime is executed fully within the browser. The Playground supports most of the core API, and can be used to write multi-dataflow applications and Portal applications, as described in the other two demonstrations.

The Portals Playground is implemented with Scala using the Scala-JS library. Thus, the core runtime (Scala) and the JavaScript runtime share most of the code-base. This enables Portals to run both on lightweight edge devices with the JS runtime, and on cloud instances with the JVM runtime.

The Playground is available at [https://portals-project.org/playground/](https://portals-project.org/playground/).
